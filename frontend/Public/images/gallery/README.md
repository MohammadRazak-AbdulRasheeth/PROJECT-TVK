# Gallery Images

Please add your TVK and Vijay images to this folder. 

## Current image references in code:

The images should be named exactly as referenced in the images.ts file, or you can update the file paths there.

For now, placeholder images will be shown if the actual images are not found.

## Instructions:
1. Add your gallery images to this folder
2. Use web-optimized formats (JPG, PNG, WebP)
3. Compress images for faster loading
4. Recommended max width: 1200px
5. Keep file sizes under 500KB each for best performance

## File naming:
- Use descriptive names
- No spaces in filenames (use hyphens or underscores)
- Include proper file extensions (.jpg, .png, etc.)
